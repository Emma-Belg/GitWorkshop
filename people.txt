    Elon Musk 

        Electric cars. Space rockets. Residential solar power. Any one of Elon Musk’s undertakings could overwhelm the
        average person, but not the 45-year-old Musk. His seemingly superhuman drive has produced spectacular results:
        Tesla is now worth over $50 billion, while SpaceX has successfully demonstrated reusable rocket technology. But
        he expects the same superhuman performance from those around him, making him a tough boss to work for. His
        latest endeavour? Driven by worry that artificial intelligence will supplant humanity, he’s working on a project
        to meld people’s brains with powerful computers.
